# Getting Started

**CAPTCHA22** requires a working [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) install. To verify your tensorflow installation, execute the following:

```
python -c 'import tensorflow as tf'
```

*CAPTCHA cracking is most efficient on a GPU-enabled Tensorflow build. Considering hosting such a server either locally or using a resource such as AWS for server hosting*

To host CAPTCHA models, the [Tensorflow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving) addon is also required.

## Installation 

To install the current release of **CAPTCHA22**:

```bash
$ pip install captcha22
```

To update **CAPTCHA22** to the latest version, add `--upgrade` flag to the above command.

## Usage 

**CAPTCHA22** consists of two main components: the [**server**](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/captcha_cracking/captcha22_server.py), *which will host the server and API*; and the [**client**](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/captcha_cracking/captcha22_client.py), *which allows you to interface with the server, run offline scripts, and automate CAPTCHA cracking attacks.*

1. Run the server:

    ```bash
    $ captcha22_server server & captcha22_server api
    ```
    _**OR** for only the cracking server, use:_
    ```bash
    $ captcha22_server server
    ```

    For a list of server commands and arguments, use:
    ```bash
    captcha22_server -h
    ```

2. Run the client:

    ```bash
    $ captcha22_client api
    ```
    _**OR** chose a cracking script and use:_
    ```bash
    $ captcha22_client cracker <script>
    ```

    For a list of client commands, scripts, and arguments, use:
    ```bash
    $ captcha_client -h
    ```
